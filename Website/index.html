      The high school that I went to was Maple High School. When I graduated from Maple High School,
      I received Ontario Scholar as well as Grade 12 Law award as my achievements during my time. Currently, I am
      enrolled in York University computer science program,
      which is part of the Lassonde School of Engineering. I began my journey at York University on September 7, 2016,
      as my interest in programming was growing substantially, acknowledging that the field of computer science is
      expandable. Prior to enrolling into university I had very little knowledge
      about computer science in a logical an programming stand point. But as the years how gone past I grew more an
      more
      confident that my skills were growing beginning to grow a passion about computer
      programming and the logic that applies in solving problems.
